## ✨ Features

### ⏳ Liquid Timer
A visual representation of time passing. Instead of a boring countdown, watch as the "cosmic water" level within the ring slowly depletes, powered by a custom wave animation.

### 🎵 Generative Ambient Music
No looped MP3s here. The application uses the **Web Audio API** to generate real-time ambient soundscapes directly in your browser. Every session provides a unique sonic experience, ensuring you never get tired of the background noise.

### 🪐 Chill Corner
Relax in zero gravity. The "Chill Corner" features floating elements like coffee, books, and music notes that drift aimlessly in the vacuum of space, adding to the relaxing atmosphere.

### 🖱️ Interactive Design
*   **Custom Cursor**: A ring-and-dot cursor that follows your movement with smooth inertia.
*   **Satisfying feedback**: Every interaction is accompanied by subtle, synthesized sound effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
*   **CSS3**: Modern CSS variables, glassmorphism effects, and keyframe animations.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: Built with ES6+ classes. No heavy frameworks—just pure, performant code.
    *   *External Dependency*: [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for beautiful, lightweight icons.
